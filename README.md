# Votely

Welcome to Votely! This application was created to make group activity planning more inclusive and democratic. To get started with using the application, please visit either https://votely-492k.firebaseapp.com/ or https://votely-492k.web.app/ (both links will work, but in case one link is down you have an extra).

NOTE: Votely cannot be run locally on your computer as the various pages on the site require you to be logged in with your Google account.

1. Once you are on the login page, please click on the “Sign In With Google” button (don’t worry, we aren’t saving any sensitive information, just your name and email address). Select a Google account to register with, and wait for the login to happen.
2. Once you are registered and logged in, you will be redirected to the User Dashboard page. This is where you will see what groups you are a part of. Since you are a new user, there will not be any groups displayed.
3. To check if your Google profile has been imported properly, click on the “Profile” button at the top-right of the page. Then click “Profile Settings.” On this page, you should see your Google profile image, name, and email address. To go back to the User Dashboard, click on “Your Profile” at the top-left of the page.
4. To get started, click on the “+ Add” button at the bottom-right of the User Dashboard page. You will now have the option to Create or Join a group.
5. To create a new group, enter a group name, description, and custom group ID (you can pick your group ID). 
6. To join a group, make sure the group you want to join exists first. Then, enter the group name and ID to join. If the group doesn’t exist, you will get the following message: “No group found with the provided name and ID.”
7. Once you create or join a group, you will see the group displayed on your User Dashboard. To enter the group you have created or joined, click on the “Enter” button on the group card. 
8. Once you click “Enter,” you will be redirected to the Group Dashboard page. This is where you will see the Itineraries group members have proposed. 
9. To propose an itinerary to the group members, click on the “+ Add” button at the bottom-right of the page again. A window will pop-up, and you will be prompted to enter a title for the itinerary you are proposing, as well as a description of the itinerary. Once you fill both these fields out and click “Create,” the itinerary will be added to the dashboard. 
10. Once itineraries are created, you can see there are Yes and No buttons on the itinerary cards. These are what you will click to vote on an itinerary. 
11. Once there are 2 or more itineraries created for a group, a 30-second timer will be started in the background. This is your window of time to vote on the itineraries. 
12. Once the 30-second timer finishes, the page will calculate which itinerary had the most Yes votes and will select that as the winning itinerary for the group.
13. When the winning itinerary is selected, you will get an alert/notification from the page indicating which itinerary won and its details. The itineraries in the group will then be deleted as voting has finished for those itineraries. 
14. To log out of Votely, click on the “Profile” button at the top-right again, then select the “Logout” button. You will be redirected to the Login page afterwards. 

We are looking to add more features (like other notifications for a more seamless user experience) as time goes on. We hope you enjoy using Votely!
